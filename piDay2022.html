        <h1>Co-prime Probability to Calculate Pi</h1>
        <a style="font-size: 20px;">The probability that two random numbers  are co-prime (meaning they do not share any factors besides 1)
         is equal to six divided by pi squared.</a> <br><br>
        <a style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 100px;">For pi day 2022 I calculated pi using this method. 
            I generated quasi random numbers using a shuffled deck of cards. 
            I took two cards off the top of the deck, added them together, and did the same again with the next two cards. 
            Adding the cards together gave me a wider range of random numbers. 
            I then compared the cards for co-primaliy and marked down if they were or not co-primes. 
            I did this comparison 100 times. The ratio of co-primes to total comparisons is x in the equation below.

        <a style="font-size: 1.5vw;">Although I got a number staggeringly close to pi, I later realized that I 
            had creating a distribution about the value of 14 by adding two random cards together. I made sure of my mistake by 
            graphing the chances of getting numbers 1:26 in MATLAB and found I truly did make a mistake. The graph of the distribution if below.
